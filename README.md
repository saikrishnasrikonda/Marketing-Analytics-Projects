# Marketing-Analytics-Projects
This project analyzes over 18,000 Instagram posts to uncover strategies for influencers to increase engagement (likes and comments). Using CRISP-DM methodology, we explored factors such as post timing, content type, captions, hashtags, and follower counts. The results suggest tailored strategies for micro and macro influencers to optimize their posts and grow engagement. Key findings include optimal posting times, effective caption features, and content strategies, helping influencers enhance their visibility and interactions on Instagram.
